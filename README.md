This paper describes that Crime analysis is performed using an ensemble of Naive Bayesian Classification, Random Forestand Support Vector machine algorithms. In this technique, team has calculated and given the result of the accuracy for the provided terms and data. System is able to get prediction automatically with this approach and approximate outcome for a big division of Crime analyzed data and expressions by comparing and deploying efficient algorithms that are significantly better and thereby achieving results in minimal span of time.
